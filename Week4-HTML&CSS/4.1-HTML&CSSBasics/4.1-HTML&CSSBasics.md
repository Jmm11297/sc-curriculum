# HTML & CSS Basics
We've got some fundamental understanding of programming by now, but only some limited application. The main purpose for learning JavaScript is to be able to apply it in our browsers. To do that, we'll need to learn some HTML so that we can create some content for the browser. And, while we are at it, we'll want to learn some CSS so that we can make our content look 'nice.'

## HTML
**HTML** (**H**yper-**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) is a _markup language_ for describing the _structure_ and _content_ of web documents/pages. HTML is the building block of the web and the only thing you _need_ to build a website. A **markup language** is one that encodes or 'describes' or '_tags_' pieces of text, but it lacks any real 'syntax' or 'programming logic' - it doesn't actually _do_ anything besides 'describe content.'

**HTTP** (**H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) is a convention or 'system' or 'a set of rules and guidelines' for transferring _HyperText_. HTML and HTTP are the foundation of the WorldWide Web. 

### Tags and Text
HTML is comprised of markup **tags** and **text** content _nested_ inside each other. The '_text content_' is what we see on the page, and the *tags* describe or 'mark up' that text to give it structure.

HTML **tags** are keywords (tag _names_) surrounded by angle brackets: `<html>`

HTML tags normally come in pairs like: `<p> and </p>`

The first tag in a pair is the _start tag_, the second tag is the _end tag_.
The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a _slash_ ( `/` ) before the tag name.

### HTML Boilerplate
By following the proscribed rules of HTML, a web browser understands this to be a _document_ with a _heading_ and a _paragraph_. Here is what the browser interpreter thinks when given this code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
- The `!DOCTYPE` declaration defines the _document type_ to be `HTML`
- The text between `<html>` and `</html>` describes an _HTML document_
- The text between `<head>` and `</head>` provides information about the document
- The `<meta>` tag tells your computer you are using the [UTF-8 *character set*](https://youtu.be/MijmeoH9LT4)  (which is the character set for most of the web) - this guards your site from turning into
gibberish
- The text between `<title>` and `</title>` provides a _title_ for the document (displayed in the browser 'tab')
- The text between `<body>` and `</body>` describes the _visible page content_
- The text between `<h1>` and `</h1>` describes a _heading_
- The text between `<p>` and `</p>` describes a _paragraph_

> **TIP**: Remember, with emmet.io, we can enter `!` in a blank HTML file to autofill some boilerplate HTML

### Attributes
This anchor tag has an **attribute** whose _name_ is `href` and whose _value_ is a url: 
```html
<a href="http://www.somewebsite.com">Some text that links to the site</a>
```

Attributes provide additional information about an element. They appear on the _opening tag_ of the element and are made up of two parts: a **name** and a **value**, separated by an equals sign.

Image tags (`<img>`) have an attribute named src whose value is the location of the image to be displayed, like this (Notice the image tag is one of a few HTML elements that do not require a ending tag.):
```html
<img src="link-to-image">
```

`class` and `id` are two _global attributes_ that can be attached to _any_ element in order to select and access specific elements. You can create as many classes and IDs as you need, and you can use each **class** as many times as you need, but each **ID** should only be used _once_. 

```html
<div class="one-class another-class" id="specificID"></div>
```

### `<div>` and `<span>` tags
The `<div>` element is a _generic block element_ which defines a _section_ of your page. Unlike block elements with specific meaning and implied default styling (like `<h1>` and `<p>` tags), `<div>` elements _don't change the appearance of the page until styles are applied to them_.

 The `<span>` element is a _generic inline element_ which defines a _section_ of your page. Unlike inline elements with specific meaning and implied default styling (like `<b>` and `<i>` tags), `<span>` elements _don't change the appearance of the page until styles are applied to them_.

### Other Common HTML Tags
- `<header>` & `<footer>` (sections)
- `<h1>` - `<h6>` (headings)
- `<main>` & `<nav>` ('main' and navigation sections)
- `<ol>`, `<ul>`, & `<li>` (list elements)
- `<form>` & `<input>`
- `<button>`

### **Exercise 1 (Everyone)**: 
#### Examine various HTML elements: [example.html](4.1-Activities\example.html)
1. First, examine `example.html` in VS Code. Try to imagine what would display and how.
2. Then, Copy the Path to the `example.html` file using Ctrl + Alt + C, or right click on the file in VS Code and select "Copy Path."

### **Exercise 2 (Students)**: 
#### Create an HTML bio/portfolio: [index.html](4.1-Activities\index.html)
1. Enter `!` in [index.html](4.1-Activities\index.html) to load boilerplate HTML
2. Using HTML, create a bio or portfolio that includes the following:
    - An updated **title** tag
    - At least two **lists**
    - Multiple **headings** and at least one **paragraph**
    - At least one **image**
    - At least two **links**
3. Explore the [MDN Documentation on HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to find out more about HTML tags.

## CSS
There are three ways to give HTML content some styles:

- inline styles (the `style` _attribute_)
- style tags (`<style>` in document `<head>` tag)
- stylesheets (_external .css documents_ linked with `<link>`)

```html
<link href="css/main.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

 It's better for each page to reference a single stylesheet, containing all of the CSS rules for the page. By keeping all of your CSS rules in an external document, you'll find that it's easier to make changes across a website, maintain separate roles on a dev team, and save yourself from early-onset carpal tunnel because of re-typing.

 #### General CSS Syntax
 ```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
 ```

 ### Basic CSS Selectors
 - `*` - **universal selector**: selects _all_ HTML elements
 - `elementName` - **type selector**: selects all of that type of _element_
 - `.className` - **class selector**: `.` selects all elements of that _class_
 - `#idName` - **id selector**: `#` selects the element with that _id_

 The basic CSS selectors can be chained together to get more specific
 ```css
li.favorties {
  /* selects all list items with the class "favorites" */
}
 ```

### The CSS Box Model
Every HTML _element_ has a **box** around it, even if you cannot see it. We can show a visible _border_ around every HTML element on the page using the CSS `border` _property_ and the "match all" _selector_ ( `*` ):
```css
* {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```
The CSS `padding` property defines the _extra space inside_ the border:
```css
div {
  padding: 10px;
}
```
The CSS `margin` property defines the _extra space outside_ the border:
```css
div {
  margin: 30px;
}
```
You can also assign different values to the **padding** or **margin** on _each side_ of an element with specific properties or through the shorthand padding property. As an example, the following three padding constructs compile to the same appearance:
```css
div {
  padding-top: 5px;
  padding-right: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 5px;
  padding-left: 10px;
}
div {
  padding: 5px 10px 5px 10px;
}
div {
  padding: 5px 10px;
}
```
#### Other CSS Properties
- `background`
- multiple `font-` & `text-` properties
- `height` & `width`
- `z-index`

### Complex CSS selectors
As our documents grow, we'll need to leverage more complex CSS selection syntax. Here are a few important selectors to cherish and to keep:

- **grouping selectors**: use a _comma_ to specify _more than one_ selector
- **descendant selectors**: use a _space_ to select nodes that are _descendants_ of the first element
- **child selectors**: use `>` to select _direct_ descendants of the first element
- **general sibling selector**: use `~` to select siblings that follow the first element
- **direct sibling selector**: use `+` to select the next sibling that follows the first element

```css
/* grouping */
div, .flex {
  /* selects all div elements and all elements with the class "flex" */
}

/* descendant */
main div {
  /* selects all div elements that are nested within the main element */
}

/* child */
#movie-list>li {
  /* selects all list items that are direct descendants of the element with id "movie-list" */
}

/* general sibling */
.gallery-title~img {
  /* selects all sibling image tags that follow the element with class "gallery-title" */
}

/* direct sibling */
footer+p {
  /* selects the next paragraph element that is a sibling with the footer element */
}
```

These rules might seem like overkill right now, but they're extremely useful for when you have large stylesheets of CSS rules that apply across multiple pages. Speaking of which...

### Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements
There are some selectors that can be used to make some very basic calculations about the state of your markup, and add styles accordingly. These aren't real classes or selectors, since they aren't able to select anything on their own. Rather, these are used to filter the results of a selector into a useful subset of HTML elements to style. Here are a few of the most useful pseudo-classes:
```css
/* :first-child */
li:first-child {
  // applies to the first list item of every list
}
/* :last-child */
li:last-child {
  // applies to the last list item of every list
}
/* :nth-child(n) */
li:nth-child(2) {
  // applies to the second list item of every list
}
/* :nth-child(an) */
li:nth-child(2n) {
  // applies to every other list item of every list
}
/* :hover */
li:hover {
  // applies to every list item the user is hovering over
}
```

### **Exercise 3 (Students)**
#### Practice with CSS: [styles.css](4.1-Activities\styles.css)
1. Add a `<link>` tag to `index.html` to link your CSS file to your HTML
2. Add some styling to your bio/portfolio HTML. You may need to add new HTML elements or attributes. Include the following types of CSS selectors:
    - **class & id selectors**
    - **chain** a class selector onto a element selector
    - **group** two or more selectors
    - select all the **child list items** from one of your lists
    - select an element that is a **sibling** of another element
3. Explore the Box Model by including the following CSS rules:
    - use the universal selector to give all elements a **border**
    - add **padding and margin** on some elements
    - add **padding and margin only on certain sides** of some elements
4. Using **pseudo-classes**, have at least one element change color when someone **hovers** over it
